                <p>I am a third-year undergraduate student at <em>Swarthmore College</em> majoring in <em>Statistics</em> and <em>Computer Science</em>. 
                    I am interested in developing statistical and machine learning models that address real-world problems. Recently, I am working on autoregressive models that predict influenza hospitalization rates
                    with Google Trends data.
                <br>
                <br>
                    I also interned at the strategic investment division at Xiaohongshu (Rednote), which inspired my interest in social media platforms. I hope to develop more statistical tools
                    that could help analyze data from online platforms and support research in various fields.
